## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The planning phase went smoothly overall. Coming up with the project idea was straightforward since it's based on a real problem we've all experienced during job searching. The GitHub repo got set up and the initial planning documents were completed on time. Writing the user stories felt natural because the app solves problems we understand from personal experience.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Just the usual stuff with group projects - everyone's got different schedules and it takes forever to get responses sometimes. We also started way too ambitious with features and had to cut back to something actually doable. Figuring out what's realistic to build in a few weeks was harder than expected.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

The resume tracking thing is probably gonna be tricky since we haven't done anything like that before. Also building an actual dashboard with charts instead of just tables is new for us. Mostly just need help when we inevitably break something or get stuck on bugs, and maybe some tips on keeping the code organized as it gets bigger.
