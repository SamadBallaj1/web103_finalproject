## About

### Description and Purpose

JobTrackr is a full-stack web application that helps job seekers manage their internship and job applications in one centralized platform. Users can track companies, manage applications with different resume versions, monitor interview stages, and set follow-up reminders. The app features a dashboard with analytics and insights to help users understand their job search progress and improve their application strategy.

### Inspiration

Last semester during internship recruiting, I applied to over 40 companies and quickly lost track of everything in a messy Excel spreadsheet. I would forget to update statuses, miss follow-up deadlines, and couldn't remember if I had already applied to a company when I saw the same position reposted. After talking with my teammates, we realized we all had the same problem - some were using Google Sheets, others had notes scattered across different apps, and one of us was keeping a paper notebook that kept getting lost. We tried existing tools but found them either too complicated, locked behind paywalls, or they only worked as Chrome extensions. We wanted something simple, mobile-friendly, and free. As students who just learned full-stack development, we realized we could build exactly what we needed. That shared frustration became JobTrackr.
